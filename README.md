# Chirp-Social

## Description
*Chirp* is a "Twitter-like" social network site that allows the user to post "chips", follow other users, like/unlike posts, and more. This application was the fourth project assignment for CS50W Programming with Python and JavaScript with specified requirements. 

## Specifications and Distribution Code
See the requirements/specifications for [Project 4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/4/network/) here.  The distribution code from HarvardX for Project 4 included a typical Django Application Boilerplate project with a boilerplate Network application. The Login, Logout and Register view functions and basic templates were included in the distribution code as well, and everything else was written by me (Ben Hogan).

## Current State
Chirp has only been designed to run on a development server and is not desiged to be used as a public application. Currently the application is fully functional when run on Django's development server. UnitTests are not extensive and are not comprehensive for the server-side, and client-side testing with Selenium has not been implemented yet.
